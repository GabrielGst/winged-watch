Computes the best sailing course for a sail boat according to winds, ocean currents and the boat's draft.

This project is led by Gabriel Gostiaux, student in engineering at Institut of Optics in Palaiseau, FRANCE.

## Description

The application will work from data provided by Open-Meteo Weather API database (website: https://open-meteo.com/ - git: https://github.com/open-meteo/open-meteo) which gathers meteorogical data from national weather services.

The goal of the app is to computes an optimal course for a sailing boat according to natural constraints (wind, tidal and ocean currents) and based on navigation rules.

## Specs

1) the app should show the bathymetric map at different scales,
2) the app should show the wind forecast,
3) the app should show the ocean currents forecast,
4) the app should show the tidal heights forecast,
5) the app should show basics marine beacons,
6) the app should show the optimal sailing course,
7) the app should provide a list of timed directions to follow the computed course.
